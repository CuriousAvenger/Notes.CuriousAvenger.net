## Social Engineering Attacks  
Techniques leveraging human psychology to breach security.

### Methods of Influence  
- **Authority**: Compliance due to perceived power  
  - Impersonate bosses, IRS agents  
- **Urgency**: Prompt action under time pressure  
  - “Reset your password now for meeting”  
- **Social Proof**: Influence via others’ behavior  
  - Fake likes/shares; use mutual connections  
- **Scarcity**: Limited availability prompts action  
  - “Only 3 seats left—register now!”  
- **Likeness**: Build rapport via shared interests  
  - Friendly banter, flirting to gain trust  
- **Fear**: Threat-based compliance  
  - Fake FBI warning; ransomware scare

### Phishing Campaigns  
- **Phishing**: Mass fraudulent emails to steal credentials  
- **Spearphishing**: Targeted emails using personal info  
- **Whaling**: High-stakes phishing of executives  
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: Hijack corporate accounts  
- **Vishing**: Voice-based social engineering  
- **Smishing**: SMS-based phishing


> Also look into `settoolkit` this is a robust tool that I personally like when it comes to social engineering. 

#### Gophish (Phishing Simulation)  
- Open-source phishing framework  
- **Setup a Campaign**:  
  1. Define **Sending Profile** (SMTP host, port, from address)  
  2. Create **Email Template** (mimic IT dept)  
  3. Launch **Campaign**: track opens, clicks, submissions  
- **Example Send Profile**:  
```text
  Name: Morning Catch
  Interface: SMTP
  From: Boyd Jenius <bjenius@morningcatch.ph>
  Host: 192.168.56.101:25
```

### Impersonation & Pretexting

- **Impersonation**: Pretend to be trusted roles
    - Delivery person, support technician
- **Physical Pen Tests**:
    - Wear uniforms (UPS, ISP logos) to enter restricted areas
- **Elicitation**: Extract info via conversation
    - Ask to print test page to see copier IP

---

### Surveillance Techniques

- **Eavesdropping**: Listen to conversations (bugs, overhearing)
- **Shoulder Surfing**: Observe screens/keypads in public
- **Dumpster Diving**: Recover sensitive data from trash

---

### Watering Hole Attacks

Compromise sites frequented by targets:
1. **Recon**: Identify popular sites
2. **Compromise**: Inject malicious code or ads
3. **Infection**: Visitors unwittingly download malware
- **Defenses**: patch sites, use filters, employee training

### Evilginx (MFA-Bypassing Phishing)

- **MITM Proxy**: Hooks victims’ sessions via reverse proxy
- **Process**:
    1. Host real-time clone of login page
    2. Capture credentials + session tokens
    3. Hijack account even with MFA

---

### Tailgating & Piggybacking

- **Tailgating**: Unauthorized entry behind someone
- **Piggybacking**: Invited entry by authorized person
- **Prevention**: mantraps, security personnel, training

### Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)

- Exploits browser vulnerabilities via XSS hooks
- **Workflow**:
    1. **Hook** browser via malicious JS
    2. **Control** sessions through GUI modules
    3. **Modules**: steal cookies, keylogger, screenshots

> **Tip**: Ethical use only in authorized engagements to highlight browser security gaps.
