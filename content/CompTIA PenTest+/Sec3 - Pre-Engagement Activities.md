## Objectives  
1. **1.1** Summarize pre-engagement activities  
2. **1.2** Explain collaboration and communication activities  

---

## Pre-Engagement Activities  
- Basic tasks to prepare for a penetration test  
- Break down complexities of test preparation  
- Ensure alignment, legality, and success  

---

## Regulations & Standards  

### Regulations  
- Legal mandates for data protection and testing processes  
- **GDPR**  
  - Applies in the EU and to EU citizens’ data  
  - Requires explicit consent, DPIAs, DPO appointment  
  - Fines up to 4% of global turnover or €20 M  
- **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)**  
  - US law protecting financial information  
  - Mandates encryption, access controls, ongoing assessments  
- **HIPAA**  
  - US healthcare data privacy and security  
  - Requires physical, administrative, technical safeguards  
  - Encryption, secure access controls, regular audits  
  - Fines $100–$50 000 per violation (up to $1.5 M annually)  

### Standards  
- Voluntary but best-practice frameworks  
- **PCI DSS**  
  - Secures payment card data: network security, access controls, logging  
  - Fines $5 000–$100 000 per month until compliance  
- **ISO/IEC 27000 Series**  
  - ISMS framework for information security management  

---

## Stakeholder Alignment  
- Ensure all parties (technical teams to executives) share goals, budget, timelines  
- Example: GLBA compliance for a financial client  
- Ongoing training, debriefings, and audits to maintain alignment  

---

## Summary  
- Regulations and standards guide test processes and ethics  
- Stakeholder alignment ties objectives to business and compliance needs  
- Testers must uncover vulnerabilities while upholding legal and ethical requirements  

---

## Types of Assessments  
- **Network**: topology review, firewall configuration, policy alignment  
- **Wireless**: encryption checks, rogue AP detection, attack simulation  
- **Application**: code and dependency review for vulnerabilities  
- **Mobile**: data leakage, session handling, storage security  
- **Web**: SQL injection, XSS, misconfigurations  
- **Cloud**: provider controls, resource configuration (e.g., S3 buckets)  
- **API**: authentication, authorization, data validation checks  

---

## Types of Agreements  
- **NDA**: confidentiality of test findings  
- **MSA**: overarching service terms (scope, payment, liability)  
- **SoW**: project details (objectives, deliverables, timelines)  
- **ToS**: usage rules for testing services and proprietary tools  

### Key Points  
- NDA protects sensitive information  
- MSA streamlines recurring engagements  
- SoW clarifies project expectations  
- ToS governs service usage and tool protection  

---

## Legal & Ethical Considerations  
- **Authorization Letter**: defines scope, validity, data handling, reporting  
- **Mandatory Reporting**: secure disclosure, legal exceptions, counsel consultation  
- **Risk Awareness**: assess potential damage, implement safeguards (e.g., rate limiting)  
- **Escalation Path**: predefined contacts and procedures for incidents  

### Key Points  
- Authorization: clearly define permitted activities  
- Reporting: maintain confidentiality and legal compliance  
- Risk: minimize unintended impact  
- Escalation: know whom to contact for issues  

---

## Rules of Engagement  
- **Exclusions**: list off-limits systems (e.g., live transaction platforms)  
- **Test Cases**: predefined scenarios based on known threats  
- **Testing Window**: agreed timeframes to limit operational impact  
- **Goal Reprioritization**: adjust focus as new vulnerabilities emerge  
- **Business Impact Analysis**: assess consequences of exploited findings  

### Key Points  
- Exclusions prevent accidental disruption  
- Test cases ensure systematic coverage  
- Testing windows align with business needs  
- Reprioritization targets the highest-risk issues  
- Impact analysis links vulnerabilities to business risk  

---

## Target Selection  
- **CIDR**: defines IP ranges (e.g., 192.168.100.0/24)  
- **Domains**: target DNS and public-facing resources  
- **IP Addresses**: individual hosts for port/service scanning  
- **URLs**: specific endpoints for web-app testing  

### Key Points  
- CIDR ensures full network coverage  
- Domains reveal subdomain and DNS weaknesses  
- IPs are potential entry points  
- URLs focus on precise application vulnerabilities  

---

## Shared Responsibility Model  
- **Hosting Providers**: secure data centers, network, hardware, virtualization  
- **Customers**: secure OS, applications, patching, configs, data encryption  
- **Penetration Testers**: audit controls, simulate attacks, report findings  
- **Third-Party Providers**: secure integration software and updates  

### Cloud Provider Services  
- AWS: Trusted Advisor, Inspector  
- Azure: Security Center, Advisor  
- GCP: Security Command Center, Cloud Armor  

### Example Scenario  
- E-commerce on Azure:  
  - Azure secures infrastructure  
  - Customer secures VMs, apps, databases  
  - Tester evaluates web app and network  
  - Payment gateway provider ensures PCI DSS compliance  

### Key Points  
- Providers handle infrastructure security  
- Customers manage their software and data security  
- Testers identify and validate vulnerabilities  
- Third parties must maintain ongoing product security
