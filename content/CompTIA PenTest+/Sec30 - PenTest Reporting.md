## Report Structure

- **Executive Summary**
    - **Introduction**: Purpose/scope—what was tested, why, objectives  
    - **Methods**: High-level approach (e.g., PTES, OpenVAS, Burp Suite)  
    - **Key Findings**: Major vulnerabilities in plain terms—impact and risk  
    - **Security Posture**: Overall assessment and urgency  
    - **Conclusion**: Recap insights; **Call to Action** for prompt remediation  
    - *Importance*: Ensures non-technical stakeholders understand risks and next steps

- **Root Cause Analysis**
    - Identify underlying issues to prevent recurrence  
    - **Examples**:
        - **Physical Security Gaps**: Unlocked server rooms → direct access  
        - **Policy Non-Compliance**: Weak passwords, credential sharing  
        - **Insufficient Training**: Phishing susceptibility  
        - **Patch Management Lapses**: Unpatched software (e.g., EternalBlue)  
        - **OS Hardening Gaps**: Unnecessary services/ports  
        - **Poor Dev Practices**: Lack of input validation → SQLi/XSS  
        - **Outdated Protocols**: SNMPv1/v2, Telnet, FTP in plaintext  
        - **Weak Crypto**: Deprecated ciphers instead of AES/RSA  
    - *Benefit*: Guides targeted mitigation and strengthens security

- **Report Components**
    - **Executive Summary** (for non-technical audience)  
    - **Methodology**: Frameworks/tools (OpenVAS, Burp, John the Ripper)  
    - **Detailed Findings**: Tabulated vulnerabilities, CVSS scores, exploitability  
    - **Attack Narrative**: Step-by-step test activities illustrating exploit paths  
    - **Recommendations**:
        - Actionable fixes for each finding  
        - Address root causes (e.g., improve physical controls, update software)

- **Risk Scoring & Prioritization**:
	- Use CVSS (Low–Critical) to rank urgency  
	- **Technical Impact**: Data loss, downtime  
	- **Business Impact**: Financial loss, reputation, legal penalties

- **Definitions**:
	- **Vulnerability**: System weakness exploitable by threat  
	- **Exploit**: Method/tool using a vulnerability  
	- **Risk**: Likelihood of threat exploiting vulnerability × impact  
	- **Impact**: Consequences (financial, reputational, operational)  
	- **Threat**: Actor/event causing harm (e.g., hacker, malware)  
	- **Mitigation**: Steps reducing risk (patches, configs)  
	- **Remediation**: Fixing vulnerabilities (updates, policies)  
	- **Attack Vector**: Path for attack (phishing, brute force)  
	- **Penetration Testing**: Simulated attack to reveal weaknesses  
	- **Zero-Day**: Unknown vulnerability without a patch  
	- **Encryption**: Convert plaintext to ciphertext to protect data  
	- **Firewall**: Controls network traffic per security rules

- **Limits & Assumptions**
    - **Scope**: Only in-scope systems/networks tested; others may be unassessed  
    - **Time**: Fixed timeframe may leave gaps  
    - **Resources**: Budget, tools, and expertise limit depth  
    - **Access**: Restricted permissions can hinder testing  
    - **False Positives/Negatives**: Automated tool results need manual verification  
    - **Environment Stability**: Assumes no changes during test  
    - **Authorized Access**: Assumes testers have necessary permissions  
    - **Attacker Simulation**: Models a skilled but not elite attacker  
    - **Limited Impact**: Aim to minimize disruption, but some risk of interruptions  
    - **Remediation Commitment**: Assumes vulnerabilities will be fixed; may not occur

- **Special Considerations**
    - **Reporting Considerations**: Tailor technical depth for varied stakeholders; use clear structure, tables, figures  
    - **Secure Distribution**: Encrypt report; restrict access to authorized personnel  
    - **Peer Review**: Have a qualified professional verify accuracy and completeness  
    - **Client Acceptance**: Present findings, clarify questions; obtain formal sign-off (email or worksheet)  
    - **Attestation**: Provide evidence (screenshots, packet captures) validating findings  
    - **Retesting**: Verify remediation through follow-up tests; schedule based on remediation timeline; maintain client communication
