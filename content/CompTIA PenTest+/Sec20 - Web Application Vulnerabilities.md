### Race Conditions  
- **Definition:** When the outcome depends on the timing/sequence of concurrent processes.  
	- **Dereferencing:** Code attempts to remove a pointer pointing to a memory location. 
- **Exploits:**  
  - **Dirty COW:** Linux copy-on-write flaw to write to read-only mappings.  
  - **TOCTOU:** Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use inconsistencies.  
- **Mitigations:**  
  - **Locks & Mutexes:** Enforce exclusive access to shared resources.  
  - **Deadlock Prevention:** Design/test locks to avoid hanging states.

### Buffer Overflows  
- **Definition:** Writing beyond an allocated memory buffer.  
- **Mechanism:**  
  - **Stack Smashing:** Overfill stack, NOP slide, overwrite return address to jump to attacker code.  
  - **Integer Overflow:** Arithmetic exceeds variable bounds, causing adjacent memory corruption.  
- **Mitigations:**  
  - **Patch Management:** Keep software up to date.  
  - **Secure Coding:** Input validation & boundary checks.  
  - **ASLR:** Randomize memory addresses.  
  - **DEP:** Mark data regions non-executable.

### Authentication Flaws & Insecure References  
- **Broken Authentication:**  
  - **Causes:** Weak/guessable passwords, plaintext creds, no lockout/captcha, predictable session tokens.  
	  - **Example:** `https://url.com/id=1234`
  - **Protections:** MFA, strong-password policy, rate-limiting, HTTPS + Secure/HttpOnly cookies.  
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**  
  - **Risk:** Changing object IDs (e.g. `?id=123`) to access unauthorized data.  
  - **Protections:** Enforce authorization checks, use indirect references/tokens, audit access controls.

### Improper Error Handling  
- **Definition:** Revealing sensitive info or crashing due to unhandled exceptions.  
- **Consequences:** Exposed stack traces, DB dumps, system crashes, injection vectors via error messages.  
- **Best Practices:**  
  - Custom, generic user-facing errors; log details internally.  
  - Include error logic in security reviews & pen tests.  
  - Test with Burp Suite/OWASP ZAP for edge-case errors.

### Improper Headers  
- **Definition:** Missing or misconfigured HTTP response headers.  
- **Key Headers & Benefits:**  
  - **HSTS:** Enforce HTTPS.  
  - **HPKP**: Resist impersonation with fraud certs.
  - **X-Frame-Options:** Prevent clickjacking.  
  - **X-XSS-Protection:** Enable browser XSS filter.  
  - **X-Content-Type-Options:** Disable MIME sniffing / dictate content type  
  - **CSP:** Restrict loaded resources.  
  - **X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies**: browser permission to handle data across multiple domains. Loaded as XML cross-domain policy file
  - **Referrer-Policy**: governs which referrer info should be included
  - **Expect-CT**: Certificates compliances 
  - **Feature-Policy**: enable/disable of various browser features & APIs
- **Best Practices:**  
  - Review/update headers regularly.  
  - Test with SecurityHeaders.io, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
- **Common Attacks:**
	- CSRF, XSS, Downgrade Attack, Cookie hijacking, User impersonation, clickjacking

### Code Signing  
- **Definition:** Digitally signing executables/scripts to verify author & integrity.  
- **Process:** Hash code → encrypt with private key → attach signature.  
- **Limitations:** Doesn’t guarantee code safety; vulnerable if signing environment is compromised.

### Vulnerable Components  
- **Client vs. Server Processing:** Client-side code (e.g., JS) more exposed to manipulation.  
- **APIs & Formats:**  
  - **REST/JSON:** Prone to injection if inputs unsanitized.  
  - **SOAP:** Verbose, unencrypted headers—requires strict input/output sanitization.
	  - SOAP doesn't have secure encrypted header while REST does
- **Browser Extensions & HTML5:** Risky if untrusted; watch cross-domain messaging, geolocation. 
	- tab nabbing, websockets, cross origin resource sharing, server sent events, sandbox frames
- **AJAX:** (Async web applications) Same-origin policy applies; keep session state secure.
- **Machine Code & Bytecode**: specific to processor; x86, arm
	- Bytecode aka intermediate code by Java VMs then translate into machine code

### Software Composition  
- **SCA (Software Composition Analysis):** Identify vulnerabilities in open-source libs/deps.  
- **Risks:** Outdated 3rd-party code → XSS, SQLi, CSRF, clickjacking.  
  - **Example:** Equifax breach via unpatched Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638).  
- **Tools:** OWASP Dependency-Check, Dependency-Track.  
- **Mitigations:** Monitor CVEs, apply timely patches, avoid unsafe functions (`strcpy`, `gets`), enforce regression testing.  
- **Common:** poor exception handling, security misconfigs, weak crypto (RC4, DES), information disclosures, end of support or end of life, code injections, regression issues
