### MITRE ATT&CK  
A structured **threat-modeling framework** cataloging real-world adversarial behaviors to enhance defenses.

- **MITRE**: U.S. non-profit R&D organization  
- **ATT&CK**: **Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge**  
- **Purpose**: Standardize understanding of attacker methods; build accurate threat models  
- **Funding & Access**: U.S. CERT & DHS; freely available at `https://attack.mitre.org`  
- **Tactics & Techniques**:  
  - **Initial Access**: Drive-by, Supply-chain compromise, External remote services  
  - **Persistence**: Account creation, Auth modification, Malicious browser extensions  
- **Environment Matrices**: Enterprise, Mobile, Cloud (Windows, macOS, Linux, network devices)  
- **Structured Approach**:  
  - Tactics (e.g., Execution, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion)  
  - Each tactic → specific Techniques  
- **Example**:  
  - **Technique**: Spear-phishing with malicious attachment  
  - **Scenario**: Attacker poses as regulator, lures finance user into opening a weaponized PDF  
- **Defensive Strategies**: Map detections to ATT&CK techniques to speed response and mitigation

### OWASP  
Non-profit focused on **web application security**.

- **Mission**: Make software security visible for informed risk decisions  
- **Resources**: Community-led OSS projects, global chapters, conferences  
- **OWASP Top 10**:  
  1. Broken Access Control  
  2. Cryptographic Failures  
  3. Injection  
  4. Insecure Design  
  5. Security Misconfiguration  
  6. Vulnerable Components  
  7. Identification & Auth Failures  
  8. Integrity Failures  
  9. Logging & Monitoring Failures  
  10. Server-Side Request Forgery  
- **Top 3 Explained**:  
  - **Broken Access Control**: Missing enforcement → unauthorized data/function access  
  - **Cryptographic Failures**: Improper encryption → data compromise  
  - **Injection**: Untrusted input to interpreters → unintended commands/data access  
- **Use in PenTest+**: Core checklist for web vulnerability assessments

### OWASP MASVS  
**Mobile Application Security Verification Standard** – security baseline for mobile apps.

- **Control Groups**:  
  - **STORAGE**: Encrypt data at rest; prevent leakage  
  - **CRYPTO**: Use industry-standard algorithms; manage keys securely  
  - **AUTH**: Strong authn/authz; multi-factor for sensitive ops  
  - **NETWORK**: SSL/TLS, certificate pinning  
  - **PLATFORM**: Secure WebViews, IPC controls  
  - **CODE**: Sanitize inputs; keep dependencies up to date  
  - **RESILIENCE**: Tamper detection; obfuscation  
  - **PRIVACY**: Minimal data collection; informed consent  
- **Related Guides**: MASTG (testing), MAS Checklist

### PTES  
**Penetration Testing Execution Standard** – end-to-end pentest framework.

1. **Pre-engagement**: Scoping, timelines, rules of engagement  
2. **Information Gathering**: OSINT, footprinting (passive & active)  
3. **Threat Modeling**: Asset & threat capability analysis  
4. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Validate findings with active/passive tests  
5. **Exploitation**: Simulate real attacks; demonstrate impact  
6. **Post-exploitation**: Privilege escalation, lateral movement  
7. **Reporting**: Actionable remediation for technical & non-technical audiences

### STRIDE  
Microsoft’s **threat model** covering six risk categories:

- **S**poofing — identity fraud; mitigate with strong auth  
- **T**ampering — data alteration; mitigate with hashes/MACs  
- **R**epudiation — untraceable actions; mitigate with logging/audit trails  
- **I**nformation Disclosure — data leaks; mitigate with RBAC/encryption  
- **D**enial of Service — service disruption; mitigate with rate-limiting, redundancy  
- **E**levation of Privilege — unauthorized rights; mitigate with least privilege

### Purdue Model (ICS Security)  
Hierarchical zones organizing IT/OT segmentation.

- **Level 5**: External/Vendor/Cloud (enterprise controls)  
- **Level 4**: Business IT (ERP, logistics)  
- **DMZ (3.5)**: Firewall/proxy buffer between IT & OT  
- **Level 3**: MES (manufacturing ops)  
- **Level 2**: SCADA (control systems)  
- **Level 1**: PLCs (device control)  
- **Level 0**: Physical process (sensors/actuators)  
> Ensures isolation, zone-specific security controls  

---
