## Objectives  
1. **1.1** Define the overall goal of the test (e.g. identify critical web-app vulnerabilities)  
2. **1.2** List specific sub-objectives (e.g. map public-facing assets; exploit SQL injection)

## Planning the Engagement

### 2.1 Scope Definition  
- In-scope systems/applications/networks  
- Out-of-scope items  

### 2.2 Legal & Regulatory Compliance  
- Follow applicable laws (e.g. HIPAA)  
- Meet industry-specific regulations  

### 2.3 Rules of Engagement (RoE)  
- Permitted vs. prohibited activities  
- Testing windows (e.g. off-peak only)  

### 2.4 Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)  
- Confidentiality of findings and sensitive info  

### 2.5 Statement of Work (SOW)  
- Tasks, timelines, deliverables (e.g. 4-week vulnerability assessment)  

### 2.6 Communication & Escalation Paths  
- Primary contacts for status updates  
- Immediate reporting for critical issues  

### 2.7 Client Risk Tolerance & Business Impact  
- Agreed acceptable downtime vs. test depth

## Information Gathering

### 3.1 Passive Reconnaissance  
- WHOIS, ARIN, Maltego, Recon-ng  
- Public sources: corporate website, job postings  

### 3.2 Active Reconnaissance  
- Network scans (Nmap)  
- Banner grabbing, DNS enumeration (dig/nslookup)  
- Shodan for internet-connected devices  

### 3.3 Documentation & Stealth  
- Record every finding (dates, commands, outputs)  
- Use proxies/timing to avoid detection

## Attacks & Exploits

### 4.1 Prioritizing Targets  
- Focus on high-value assets & critical CVEs  

### 4.2 Automated Frameworks  
- Metasploit for exploit development/execution  

### 4.3 Password Attacks  
- Brute-force/dictionary with Hydra, John the Ripper  

### 4.4 Phishing Attacks  
- Craft spoofed emails to harvest credentials  

### 4.5 Web Application Attacks  
- **SQL Injection** (sqlmap)  
- **XSS** (steal sessions via injected scripts)  

### 4.6 Documentation  
- Detail tools, commands, outputs, screenshots  

---

## Post-Exploitation

### 5.1 Persistence  
- Create admin accounts; scheduled tasks/cron jobs  

### 5.2 Privilege Escalation  
- Local exploits; Mimikatz for in-memory creds  

### 5.3 Lateral Movement  
- PsExec (Windows), SSH (Linux)  

### 5.4 Data Gathering & Exfiltration  
- Harvest files/databases; covert channels (DNS tunneling)  

### 5.5 Cleanup & Stealth Best Practices  
- Remove tools, clear logs, delete test accounts

## Reporting

### 6.1 Executive Summary  
- Non-technical overview of risks & impacts  

### 6.2 Scope & Methodology  
- What was tested and how  

### 6.3 Findings  
- Detailed vuln descriptions + evidence  
- Severity ratings (CVSS)  

### 6.4 Recommendations  
- Actionable fixes (patch versions, code reviews)  

### 6.5 Overall Security Posture  
- High-level strengths & weaknesses  

### 6.6 Limitations & Assumptions  
- Testing constraints (off-limits systems, time windows)  

### 6.7 Call to Action  
- Next steps: remediation priorities, retest, continuous monitoring
