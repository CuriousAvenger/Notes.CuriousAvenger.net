## Mobile Device Attacks

- **Jailbreaking (iOS)**
    - Grants **root privileges**, allows sideloading and OS modifications
    - Removes Apple’s protections; patches/upgrades may break or be unavailable
- **Rooting (Android)**
    - Grants **root access**, enables unrestricted actions
    - Methods: exploits or custom ROMs (may contain malicious code)
    - **Systemless Root**: Roots without modifying system partitions (harder to detect)
- **Sideloading**
    - Installs apps from APK/IPA outside official stores
    - Bypasses security checks; **unsigned apps** may contain malware
    - Example (ADB):
        ```bash
        adb install myapp.apk
        ```
- **Unsigned Apps**
    - Lack digital signatures → integrity cannot be verified
    - Increase risk of malware; install only from official stores
- **Security Best Practices**
    - **Device Configuration Profiles** (MDM XML policies): ensure only trusted profiles are installed
    - **Full Device Encryption**:
        - iOS: 256-bit unique ID; Android: AES
        - Protects data-at-rest if device is lost/stolen
    - **VPNs**: Secures connections at OS, app, or web layer
    - **Location Services & Geofencing**: Restrict access based on geographic boundaries

## Tools for Mobile Device Attacks

- **MobSF (Mobile Security Framework)**
    - **Static Analysis**: Decompile APK/IPA, inspect code for vulnerabilities, API keys
    - **Dynamic Analysis**: Sandbox execution, detect runtime issues
- **Frida**
    - Dynamic instrumentation for **function hooking**, memory dumps, bypass anti-root
        ```bash
        frida -U -f com.target.app -l script.js --no-pause
        ```
- **Drozer**
    - Android attack framework; probes content providers, IPC, permissions
        ```bash
        drozer console connect
        run scanner.provider.insecure
        ```
- **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**
    - CLI tool for Android device communication
    - Install/debug apps, access shell, inspect file system
        ```bash
        adb shell
        adb pull /sdcard/log.txt .
        ```

## Bluetooth Attacks

- **Bluejacking**
    - Sends unsolicited messages via Bluetooth messaging
    - Steps:
        1. Enable Bluetooth (discoverable mode)
        2. Scan for nearby devices
        3. Select device, send a contact card with a message
    - Harmless but disruptive when many users are present
- **Bluetooth Spamming**
    - Sends repeated messages or files; may exploit device vulnerabilities
    - Steps:
        1. Scan for devices (e.g., Wireshark)
        2. Collect target addresses
        3. Automate repeated sends via script/tool
    - **Mitigations**: Disable Bluetooth when not in use; non-discoverable mode; reject unknown pairing

## NFC & RFID Attacks

- **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)**
    - Components: **Tags** (embedded in badges, containers), **Readers** (identify tags)
    - Uses: Inventory tracking, access badges
    - **Risks**:
        - **Signal capture**: Older EM4100 (125 kHz) tags transmit plain data
        - **Cloning**: Read/write devices can clone vulnerable tags
    - **Modern RFID**: Higher-frequency encrypted tags reduce cloning risk
- **NFC (Near Field Communication)**
    - Short-range (~4 cm) contactless communication (payments, badges)
    - Tools: **MIFARE Classic Tool** (Android) to read/write/clone NFC tags
    - **Amplification Attack**:
        - Enhanced antennas extend range to ~20–30 cm
    - **Mitigations**: Disable NFC when unused; require user confirmation for read/write

## AI Attacks

- **Prompt Injection**
    - Malicious input causes AI to bypass security or reveal sensitive data
    - **Defenses**: Input validation/sanitization; train models to reject malicious prompts; regular security audits
- **Model Manipulation**
    - Tamper with model’s training data, parameters, or environment
    - **Defenses**: Secure training data sources; monitor for data poisoning; restrict model file access; audit regularly

## Operational Technology (OT)

- **Definition**: Systems managing physical processes (distinct from IT)
- **Key Components**
    - **ICS (Industrial Control System)**: Controls/automates processes via embedded devices
    - **DCS (Distributed Control System)**: Network of interconnected ICS in a facility
    - **Fieldbus**: Digital serial communication linking PLCs
    - **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)**: Embedded computers for automation (e.g., assembly lines)
    - **HMI (Human-Machine Interface)**: Interfaces (often **Ladder Logic**) to monitor/control PLCs
    - **Data Historian**: Collects and catalogs ICS data for incident response
    - **SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)**: Manages multi-site devices over WAN (e.g., smart meters)

---

## OT Attacks

- **Controller Area Network (CAN)**
    - Vehicle/embedded network lacking message authentication
    - **Risks**:
        - OBD-II port injection trusted by ECU
        - Remote exploits via cellular/Wi-Fi modules
- **Modbus**
    - OT protocol for PLC configuration/control (Modbus RTU or Modbus TCP)
    - Requires specialized incident response (not like standard TCP/IP)
- **DDS (Data Distribution Service)**
    - Provides interoperability and **QoS** for ICS/SCADA
    - Supports on-premise and cloud architectures
- **SIS (Safety Instrumented System)**
    - Sensors, logic solvers, and control elements (horns, lights) to prevent hazardous conditions (e.g., nuclear plant core meltdown)

## Testing OT Systems

- **Risks of Traditional IT Tools**
    - **Wireshark**: May misinterpret Modbus/DNP3/Profibus; packet capture can disrupt processes
    - **tcpdump**: Performance overhead may interrupt real-time OT operations
    - **Scapy**: Crafting/sending custom packets can cause PLC malfunctions or safety incidents
- **Recommendations**
    - Use **OT-specific security tools** (e.g., Claroty, Nozomi, Indegy) designed for ICS protocols
    - Understand protocol specifications and operational context before testing
    - Prioritize system availability and safety; avoid disruptive scans or malformed packets
