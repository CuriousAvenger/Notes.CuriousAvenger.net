- Carbon globally cycles from inorganic gaseous forms (CO2 and methane) to fixed organic compounds
- Disruptions of the standard carbon cycle by human activity leads to increase atmos carbon levels
	- This in turn heats the planet, further disruption

- Cycle Mentioned:
	- [[Forests]] - carbon absorbers
	- [[Permafrost]] - massive stores of trapped organic carbon
	- [[Atmos]] - Water vapor, jet stream and the artic
	- [[Albedo]] - Ice, light reflections and global temps
