- Seagrasses are not seaweed
- The only plants to have return back to sea. They lack stomata
- Thin cuticle layer that allows gasses and nutrients to diffuse in and out of leaves from the water
- Provide unique ecosystems for marine life.

Directly buries carbon in ocean sediments:
- Seagrass sequester 5x less carbon per year than total tidal wetlands
- Occupies 0.1%, but are responsible for 11% of organic carbon buried in ocean
- 29% have been destroyed and 1.5% lost per year
