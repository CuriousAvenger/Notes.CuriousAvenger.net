- Burning fossil fuels is reemitting carbon from ancient Carboniferous plant material. 
- Burning fossil fuels since the industrial resolution has led to an increase in CO2 in the atmosphere, resulting in global temperature rises -> unpredictability of planet. 

Plants can make global scale impacts on planet over geologic time and terrestrial plants make up the majority of biomass on our planet.  Snapshot of global [[Carbon Cycle]]: Biomass make up a small part of total carbon on earth. 

The 4 main repositories of carbon: Atoms, ocean, terrestrial ecosystems, fossil fuel reserves

Can planting more trees help solve this?
- [[Deforestation]]
- [[Restoration]]

To absorb the lifetime emissions that will be produced by every American you need to plant and maintain trees on >16 billion acres, half the landmass of Earth. 

The majority of terrestrial ecosystems are in balance between fixed and released Carbon. Some that store more than released are (Net Negative):
1) [[Peatlands]]
2) Tidal wetlands
[[Blue Carbon]]: Aquatic/coastal plants play a crucial role in global carbon sequestration

No silver bullet in combating CC:
- Protecting forests and key ecosystems
- Preserve natural ecosystems that store carbon
- Arctic peatlands store 500 gigatons of carbon: 60 years worth of global C emissions
- Technologies developed
- Blue carbon are also important and underappreciated
- Trees are temporary (but important) storage for carbon
