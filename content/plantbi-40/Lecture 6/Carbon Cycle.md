Photosynthesis and respiration are the key biological contributions to the carbon cycle. Plants respire fixed carbon, and microbes respire through the decomposition of plant matter.

Fossil Fuels:
- Ancient buried organic matter
- Burned to release CO2

Permafrost
- Frozen soils with massive stored carbon reserves
- Thawed from warming, decomposing and realeasing CO2 and methane

Joseph Priestly's bell jar experiment (1774) demonstrated that plants and animals produce gases (O2 and CO2) that are cycled between one another.  [[Plants in Carbon Cycle]]
