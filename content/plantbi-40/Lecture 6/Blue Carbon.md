- Most terrestrial environments do not result in carbon removal from atmos
- Coastal/tidal ecosystems do make up much on Earth but are large contributed to Carbon sequestration. 

[[Mangroves]]: are adapted for anaerobic sediment. 
[[Sea Grasses]]: Play a key role in storing carbon
[[Kelp]]: Lack root systems and soil to accumulate carbon
