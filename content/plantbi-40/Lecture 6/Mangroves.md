- Non photosynthetic tissue (roots) require oxygen
- Air can diffuse between sediment in normal soil; waterlogged soil, these spaces are filled with water
- Red mangroves have prop root
	- Absorbs air through lenticles in the bark
- Black mangroves have small air roots (pneumatophores) extending upwards from underground roots
	- Mangrove snorkel gear
	- Low tide, air is taken up and transported to all root tissue.

Mangrove have evolved different salt tolerance adaptations
- Red: salt exclusion - prevent salt from entering
- Black: salt excreters - removes salts from glands on leaves

Mangrove forests are rapidly lost:
- 50 years, 30-50% of mangroves lost to costal development and shrimping
- Losing them at 2% a year
