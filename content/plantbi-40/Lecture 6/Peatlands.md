Some ecosystems result in net carbon sequestration: Peatlands are carbon negative
- Peatland: Terrestrial wetland ecosystem
- Largest natural terrestrial carbon store
- Ecosystem driven by sphagnum mosses. 
- Larger trees can't grow because not enough O2 in the soil
- Waterlogged surface organic layer of soil

Waterlogged conditions of peatlands prevents organic decay and leads to organic matter due to a lack of oxygen.
- Dried, pressed peat = turf. Density of dried wood (lower than coal), but bulkier
- IPCC controversially classifies peat as a renewable fuel
	- It takes 3000 years to 3 meters to grow
- Still used in countries to burn in power plants and domestic heat.

Oxygen diffuses slowly into water. Plant matter is degraded through decomposition via respiration and respiration requires oxygen. 

Peat: The forgotten fossil fuel
- When accessible reserves were exhausted, peat digging technologies were developed
- Dutch (1100-1500) peat driven societies.
- Due to peat mining, 10% of the land area of Holland was converted to water
- Coal would take over; more energy dense.
- After [[Deforestation]] for fuel, peat and coal mining industries were born, followed by modern fossil fuel industry.

The loss of peatland through drainage particles has resulted in land subsidence, the decomposition of soil carbon

Peatlands are burned for agriculture
- Slash and burn agriculture has lead to the burning
- Agriculture: Indonesia is the third largest carbon emitter
- Burning of peat to clean for palm oil plantation - can burn for months
- Smoke and fire has killed 100,000 people - deadly smoke and smog

Peatlands are burning due to global warming, 
- Thawing of permafrost makes frozen peat vulnerable to burning
- Ground temps are 2x faster than global air temps
- Peats fires burn deeper into ground and spared quicker
- Fires can burn for weeks
