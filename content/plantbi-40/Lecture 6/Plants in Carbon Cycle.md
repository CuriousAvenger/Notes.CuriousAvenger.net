Plants are intermediary in the [[Carbon Cycle]]
- Plants [[Photosynthesis]] to fix CO2 out of the atmosphere
- Live plants in the biosphere hold onto the CO2
- Dead/decaying plant material is broken down by microbes and respire back into the atmosphere.

Plants fix C from our atmos and sequester/store it as carbon sinks
1. Sequestration: CO2 taken from the atmos during [[Photosynthesis]]
2. Storage: dead biomass is buried in soil and slowly broken down over time. The time varies and dictates how long C is stored.

A significant portion of C goes belowground into soil
- The belowground varies between plants
- Up to 20% of all fixed C from [[Photosynthesis]] is released from roots as root exudates
- This is biomass that feeds microorganisms associated with roots

Deeper [[Roots]] enable more soil carbon sequestration.
