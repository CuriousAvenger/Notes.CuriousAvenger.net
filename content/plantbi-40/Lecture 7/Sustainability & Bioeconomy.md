Our modern lifestyle is dependent on the release of GHG
- bathtub = climate. Even with slow water flow, the water will overflow
- Carbon negative: drain the tub
- Carbon neural: neither draining nor adding water
- Carbon neural approaches are key to replacing [[Petroleum]]

Carbon neural ways to decrease GHG?
- Increase use of renewable materials
- Decrease dependency on [[Petroleum]]

Carbon emissions derived from biomass are carbon neural, but combustion is positive.
1 Billion tons of biomass could be produced in US alone
- The [[Bioeconomy]] is a global industrial transition of sustainably utilizing renewable aquatic and terrestrial biomass

Land is arguable the most precious finite resource for a [[Bioeconomy]]
- If we are no longer utilizing carbon from fossils, the only source of carbon we can derive our energy and products are from plants
- Given the scale of C our economy uses, we need maximize arable land
- Double edged sword: decreasing land use -> generate carbon from lands for foot and bioeconomy Ex: eat less meat.
