All biofuels are derived from sugar
- Most microbes easily metabolize sugar
- Economics of biofuels is dictated by our ability to get access to cheaper more abundant access to [[Sugar]]

First generation of Biofuels?
- [[Sugar]] is derived from food crops: starch
- Same process as making alcohol
	- Making ethanol from corn grain
- Problems:
	- Diverts grain away from food for fuel
	- Global crisis of 2008: biofuels drove up food prices
	- Farmers encouraged to devote land for biofuel production
Second Generation: [[Lignocellulosic]]

For most cars, ethanol can only be blended in as small portion of gasoline
- Gasoline: Mixture of organic carbon from petroleum after distillation
- Ethanol only works as blend
- [[Drop in fuels]]: functionally replace petroleum fuels i.e. octane

So why not use biofuels: [[Bioeconomy]]
