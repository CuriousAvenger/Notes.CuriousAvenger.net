[[Photosynthesis]] converts CO2 to sugar, which can be stored as many different complex carbohydrates
- Two major plant polysaccharides: starch and cellulose

Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. Enzymes can break apart complex polysaccharides into their small monosaccharide constituents. 
```
Enzyme + starch => glucose
```

Converting starch to sugar (maltose):
- Lost of starch in grain; however, starch can be hard to gain access to
- Malting is the process of steeping, germinating and drying grain. Tricks seed into producing enzymes to break down starch in sugar. 

Sugar is fermented with yeast to produce ethanol ([[Biofuels]])
