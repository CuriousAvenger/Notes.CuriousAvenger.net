Plants are primary feedstock of the bioeconomy
- Plants convert CO2 to sugar via photosynthesis
- Sugar is fed to microbes to make biofuels/bioproducts. 

We've already been using microbes to produce/ferment compounds for millennia: [[Biofuels]]
- Making biofuels economically competitive market is hard

Do we need biofuels?
- [[Electrification]] of the fleet (Tesla)
- Microbes can be engineered to make products other than fuels: [[Bioproducts]]

Plants are foundation of any bioeconomy:
- There is no other source of carbon that can compete with the amount of carbon from [[Petroleum]]
- 15 years later: biofuels are still hard to make economically feasible
- Maybe in several decades to mature technology increase in use of [[Biofuels]]
