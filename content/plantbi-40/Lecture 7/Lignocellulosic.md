Sugar is derived from woody biomass: cellulose
- Derive glucose from cellulose: NOT starch
- Cellulose is composed of polymerized glucose molecules
- Cellulose is physically woven together as microfibers
- Byproducts: straw and stover
- Majority of biomass is lignocellulosic

Problem: [[Lignin]]
- Lignin precents breakdown access to cellulose
- Cell wall of plant has evolved to be extremely difficult to breakdown
	- Only some microbes have evolved to breakdown (wood-rot fungi)

Lignin coats cellulose fibrils and prevents it breakdown
- Not made of sugar
- Random logic for polymerization
