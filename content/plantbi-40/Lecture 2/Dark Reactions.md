- The ATP/NADPH from [[Light Reactions]] are used to drive the Calvin cycle.
	- 5 carbon sugar + CO2 -> 6 carbon sugar -> 2 3-carbon sugars
	- Multiple 3-carbon sugars + ATP + NADPH yields glucose and precursor 5-carbon sugar
	- Catalyzed by [[Rubisco]]


- Majority of energy from light reaction are used for carbon fixation
	- [[Rubisco]] is the key carbon fixing enzyme
