This highlights the difference between natural selection vs endosymbiosis theory. I.e. Darwin Vs Mereschokowski. 

- Darwin: Incremental change over time to assume a current form
- Integration of an existing organism with its prior evolution to find sudden profound change.

Natural selection is like survival of the fittest, while [[Endosymbiosis]] more so depends on on organism depending on another for its survival, maybe even inside which was the case with [[Cyanobacteria]]
