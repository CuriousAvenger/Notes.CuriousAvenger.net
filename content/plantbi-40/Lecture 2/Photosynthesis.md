6CO2 + 6H20 + light energy -> C6H12O6 + 6O2
Carbon dioxide + water + light => glucose + oxygen

- Originally created by [[Cyanobacteria]]

[[Global primary productivity]] is driven by photosynthesis. Organisms that carry out photosynthesis ([[Cyanobacteria]], algae, and plants) are primary producers of [[Oxygen]] in the environment.

Primary contains two modules:
- [[Light Reactions]]: converting light to chemical energy
- [[Dark Reactions]]: fixing CO2 via the Calvin cycle. 

Improving Photosynthesis:
- Better [[Rubisco]] that differentiates between O2 and CO2
- Add photoprotective pathways
- Optimize leaf surface area and placements to improve light interception
