Chlorophyll absorbs certain wavelengths of colors i.e. light and allows a plant to use this energy to power [[Photosynthesis]].
- There are 2 main chlorophyll molecules: A and B

They absorb red and blue light and energize the chlorophyll and the machinery that hold is sufficient to tear apart a water molecule for 
```
2H20 -> O2 + 4H+ + 4e-
```


The H+ formed in the above reaction are used to power the formation of ATP. The energy current of the cell. The electrons from water are also moved to an electron carrier known as NADPH leading to the [[Dark Reactions]]
