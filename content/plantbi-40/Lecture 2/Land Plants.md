Challenges: learning to breathe air

- Problem: access CO2 not the same in air compared to water
- Solution: Stomata
	- Openings in leaves to all CO2 to diffuse into leaf
	- Open stomata leads to loss of water. Learns to control to optimize water loss during photosynthesis

- Problem: Air does not given the same support as water
- Solution: [[Lignin]]
	- Massive complex polymer
	- Enables evolution of vascular tissue

- Problem: No longer in water (maintaining water moisture)
- Solution: Cuticle
	- Waxy surface on aboveground tissue

- Problem: Reproductive cells protected from harsh environments
- Solution: Sporopollenin
	- One of hardest known biopolymers that coats pollen

Consequence:
- Developed new [[Ecosystems]]
- Increased [[Weathering]]
- [[Increase CO2 uptake & increase O2 release]]
