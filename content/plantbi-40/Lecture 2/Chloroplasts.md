Chloroplasts are the active sites of [[Photosynthesis]] in an planet cell; they are a product of symbiosis between an ancestral plant cell and [[Cyanobacteria]].

Chloroplasts use a combination of pigments, protein complexes, and enzymes to capture light energy and transform it into chemical energy aka [[Chlorophyll]]

The structure:
- Inner and outer membrane similar to [[Cyanobacteria]]
- Thylakoid membrane: the internal membranes with photosynthesis machinery.
- There are also granum, lumen, stroma

**Pigments** are chemical that absorb light or specific wavelengths of light.
