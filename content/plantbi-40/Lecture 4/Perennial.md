- Providing permanent cover, they encourage higher accumulations of soil carbon and reduced erosion and surface runoff
- 70% of food calories come from annual crops


High agriculture yields depend on fertilization with mineral nutrients. Crop yields increase linearly amount of [[Fertilizer]] used.
