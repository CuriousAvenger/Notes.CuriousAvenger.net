Plant [[Roots]] are the connection between water in the soil and water vapor in our atmosphere. 
- Transpiration is the process of water vapor being lost through stomata in the leaves
- Roots are critical to our global water cycle: 10% of all moisture in the atmosphere come from transpiration

Transpiration is a proxy for plant health
- Increases the cooling of plants
- lack of water leads to closure of stomata to conserve water - increasing plant temp
- Monitoring plant temperature as a proxy of active transpiration
