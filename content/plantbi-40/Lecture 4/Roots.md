- Roots hold soil together. 
- The evolution of roots changed the landscape of land by creating the first rivers through the canalization of water flow. 
- breakdown rocks through the release of organic acids to mine for nutrients. 
- Early plants led to breakdown of rocks and the global increase of mud

Two major types of rooting systems:
- [[Rhizoids]]
- [[Roots. Other]]

In general the roots function as:
- Anchor the plant
- Enable water uptake/[[Transpiration]]
- Increase surface area with soils for nutrient uptake

Aerial Roots (brace roots) of landraces of maize can produce sticky mucilage material to enrich for nitrogen fixing bacteria.
