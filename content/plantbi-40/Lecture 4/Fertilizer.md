- Nitrogen is the major nutrient plants require
- Dinitrogen is not directly bioavailable to plants N3
- Synthetic fertilizers may not be the final solution


Industrial nitrogen fertilizer production through [[Haber-Bosch Process]] process uses 1-2% global energy supply

Crops use half the fertilizer applied to soils around them with the remaining minerals leach into the water as [[Agricultural Runoff]]. 

Bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen using the enzyme [[Nitrogenase]]
