The first trees could not be degraded leading to a buildup of organic matter
- High amounts of buried organic carbon during the Carboniferous
- [[Microbial]] decomposition of plant material is essential for balancing out carbon fixed by [[Photosynthesis]]

Plants need lignin for structural support:
- Evolution of Lignin enabled plants to grow vertically and draw water up through vasculature
- Scientists still trying to figure out how fungi evolved to breakdown lignin
