The first forests led to global decrease in atmospheric CO2
- plants are carbon sinks
- Build up of organic matter; burial led to massive coal deposits during the Carboniferous
- Led to massive glaciations (less CO2/GHG in atmosphere)

Increase of oxygen: (35% percent)
- More [[Photosynthesis]]
- No microbial degradation of plant organic matter
- Insect Giantism: insects on average 10x bigger
	- Without evolution of [[Microbial]] decomposition of plant material, no O2 confused to release CO2.

Global Implications;
- CO2 dramatically dropped
	- New C sink ([[Lignin]]) i.e. build of organic matter during the Carboniferous
	- Massive glaciations
- O2 increase
	- More [[Photosynthesis]]
	- No microbial degradation of plant matter
	- Led to large insects!
