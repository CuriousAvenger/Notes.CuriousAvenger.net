Early land plants mined rocks for minerals
- First plant-rock associations would have worn rocks down to release nutrients
- Moss covered rocks release 60x more `P` than without moss.

Early plants may have caused the first mass extinction:
- Massive [[Weathering]] of (P) would have sparked algal blooms
- Algae die and broken down by bacteria using up oxygen in water -> hypoxic dead zones -> dead of marine animals
