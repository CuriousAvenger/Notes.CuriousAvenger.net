The earliest algae fossils
- First fossil evidence of "complex" life.
- Complex does not mean multi-cellular macroscopic life
- **Putative red algal fossils**: 1.6-1.0 billion years ago

- Early plants evolved from algae
- The predecessor of green algae were Bryophytes aka [[Land Plants]]
	- [[Cyanobacteria]] -> Algae -> Bryophytes -> Pteridophytes -> Angiosperms -> Gymnosperms
