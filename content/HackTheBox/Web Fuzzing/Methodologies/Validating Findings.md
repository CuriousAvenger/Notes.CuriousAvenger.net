Fuzzing is excellent at casting a wide net and generating potential leads, but not every finding is a genuine vulnerability. The purpose of validation:

1. Confirm Vulnerabilities: Distinguishes genuine threats from false positives.
2. Assess Impact: Evaluates severity and potential consequences.
3. Reproduction: Consistently replicates issues for further investigation.
4. Gather Evidence: Prepares proof for stakeholders or developers.

 
 **Steps for Validation**

**1. Manual Verification**
- Reproduce the Request: Use tools like `curl` or a web browser.
- Analyze the Response Look for errors, anomalies, or deviations.
- Controlled Exploitation: Validate vulnerabilities with PoC while avoiding harm.

**2. Using `curl` for Validation**

```bash
curl http://IP:PORT/backup/
curl -I http://IP:PORT/backup/password.txt
```

- Key headers to analyze:
    - **Content-Type**: File type (e.g., `text/plain`, `application/sql`).
    - **Content-Length**: Indicates file size (e.g., non-zero size implies content).
