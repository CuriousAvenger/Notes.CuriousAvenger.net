Web fuzzing is a technique to identify vulnerabilities in web applications by testing inputs systematically or randomly. It helps detect flaws in input validation, error handling and overall application security.

**Differences: Fuzzing vs. Brute-Forcing**

| **Aspect**        | **Fuzzing**                                      | **Brute-Forcing**                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Approach**      | Provides unexpected, malformed, or random inputs | Attempts all possible values systematically    |
| **Purpose**       | Test how the app handles unexpected inputs       | Find a specific value like a password or key   |
| **Tool Behavior** | Uses payload mutations or random sequences       | Relies on predefined wordlists or combinations |
Analogy:
- Fuzzing: Throwing random objects at a locked door to see anything opens it.
- Brute-force: trying every key in a keyring to unlock the door.

**Why Fuzzing Web Applications?**
1. Uncover hidden vulnerabilities during manual testing
2. Automates security testing using automatic input generators.
3. Simulates real-world attacks and strategies by a AGI.
4. Identifies any gaps that allow SQL injection or XSS
5. Improves code quality by revealing bugs within the secure code.
6. Enable continuous security by integrating CI/CD pipelines

 **Essential Concepts in Fuzzing**

|**Concept**|**Description**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Wordlist**|Dictionary of potential input values used in fuzzing.|Generic: `admin`, `password`, `backup`|
|**Payload**|Actual data sent during fuzzing.|SQLi: `' OR 1=1 --`|
|**Response Analysis**|Observing application responses to detect anomalies.|Error: `500 Internal Server Error`|
|**Fuzzer**|Tool that generates payloads and analyzes responses.|Tools: `ffuf`, `wfuzz`, `Burp Suite Intruder`|
|**False Positive**|Incorrectly identified vulnerability.|404 error flagged as a flaw.|
|**False Negative**|Missed vulnerability in the application.|Undetected logic flaw in a payment system.|
|**Fuzzing Scope**|Targeted areas of the application to test.|Login page, specific API endpoint.|
