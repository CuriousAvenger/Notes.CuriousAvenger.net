This module covers the installation and use of four essential tools for web application security testing: `ffuf, gobuster, feroxbuster, wenum`. These tools aid in directory enumeration, content discovery, parameter fuzzing and brute-force attacks.

**Tools and Use Cases**

1. `ffuf` Fuzz faster U fool is a fast web Fuzzer written in Go for directory and file aka hidden files, parameter enumeration and brute-force attacks for sensitive information like login
2. `gobuster` is a directory and file enumeration tool know for its speed and simplicity. Use for content discovery i.e. hidden web directories and files, DNS subdomain enumeration and WordPress specific content detection.
3. `feroxbuster` is a recursive content discovery tools written in Rust, ideal for identifying hidden files and directories. Use mostly for nested directories and files or content that is not linked in the application.
4. `wfuzz` is a versatile command-line fuzzing tool for parameter and content discovery. Used for same as above but its a command-line tool.

**Summary**
This setup equips you with powerful tools for web application reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment.
- `ffuf` and `Gobuster` excel in speed and content discovery.
- `FeroxBuster` offers high-performance recursive scans.
- `Wenum` provides advanced fuzzing capabilities with flexible configurations.
