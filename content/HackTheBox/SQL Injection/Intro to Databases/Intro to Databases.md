Databases are used by web applications to store and manage diverse types of information, such as:
- Core assets: Images and files.
- Content: Posts and updates.
- User data: Usernames, passwords, etc.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized language for interacting with databases to perform queries and manage data efficiently.

**Database Management Systems (DBMS)**

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software designed to create, define, host, and manage databases. Over time, different types of DBMS have been developed to cater to specific use cases:

1. **File-based DBMS**: Simple storage but slow and inefficient for large datasets.
2. **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**: Stores data in structured tables with defined relationships.
3. **NoSQL**: Optimized for unstructured or semi-structured data.
4. **Graph-based DBMS**: Focused on managing relationships in graph formats.
5. **Key/Value stores**: Efficient for simple, unstructured data storage.

To interact with DBMS with Command-line tools, graphical interfaces and API and to apply these DBMS are used in sectors like banking, finance, and education to handle large-scale data efficiently.

**Key Features of DBMS:**

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Concurrency|Manages simultaneous user interactions without data corruption.|
|Consistency|Ensures data integrity across concurrent operations.|
|Security|Provides authentication and access controls to safeguard sensitive data.|
|Reliability|Enables data backup and recovery in case of data loss or system failure.|
|SQL Support|Simplifies interaction with databases using intuitive query syntax.|

**DBMS Architecture**

The architecture of a DBMS often follows a two-tiered model:
1. **Tier I (Client-side):**
    - Includes applications such as websites or GUI-based programs.
    - Handles high-level interactions (e.g., login, commenting).

1. **Tier II (Middleware):**
    - Processes user interactions and converts them into database-compatible queries. Interacts with the DBMS using libraries or drivers specific to the database type.

**Database Operations:**
- Queries like **insertion**, **retrieval**, **deletion**, and **updates** are processed by the DBMS.
- The DBMS returns requested data or error codes for invalid queries.

**Hosting Considerations:**
- Applications and DBMS can share a single host for simplicity.
- For large-scale systems, hosting them separately improves scalability and performance.
