The easiest way to get help regarding a tool is use either the `man` or `--help` to solve the problems. It is hard to memorize all the tools so the use cases are:

- `workstation@htb[\htb]$ man <tool>`
- `workstation@htb[\htb]$ <tool> --help`
- `workstation@htb[\htb]$ <tool> -h`

The results from `--help` and `-h`. Another tool that utilizes the help page and the manual pages are `apropos`. This tool searches the descriptions for instance of a given keyword.

- `workstation@htb[\htb]$ apropos <keyword>`
- `workstation@htb[\htb]$ apropos sudo`
