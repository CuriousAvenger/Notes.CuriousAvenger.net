Since we will be working with many Linux Systems, its important to learn structure and the information about the system, processors, network configuration, users, directories and user settings. A useful list of tools are:

- `whoami`  Displays current username.  
- `id`  Returns user's identity.  
- `hostname`  Sets or prints the name of the current host system.  
- `uname`  Info about OS and system hardware
- `pwd`  Returns the working directory name.  
- `ifconfig`  Network interfaces and parameters 
- `ip`  manipulate routing, network devices, interfaces, and tunnels.  
- `netstat`  Shows network status.  
- `ss`  Another utility to investigate sockets.  
- `ps`  Shows process status.
- `who`  Displays who is logged in.  
- `lsblk`  Lists block devices.  
- `lsusb`  Lists USB devices.  
- `lsof`  Lists opened files.  
- `lspci`  Lists PCI devices.  
- `env`  Prints environment or sets and executes a command.
