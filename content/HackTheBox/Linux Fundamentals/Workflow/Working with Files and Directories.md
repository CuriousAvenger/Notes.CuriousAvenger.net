The main difference between files in Linux and Windows is that Linux you can use regex commands like vim or nano to directly alter the file, which is far more efficient whereas in Windows you have to physically move into the directory using file explorer and edit.

- `touch` & `mkdir`: create an empty file and directory with given name
- `mkdir -p Storage/local/user`: creates the whole structure after the parent
- `tree`: To display the whole file structure underneath one's given directory
- `mv`: rename file and move to a different location. use `.` for current directory
- `cp`: same idea for copying files and `-r` for recursively copying files within folders.
