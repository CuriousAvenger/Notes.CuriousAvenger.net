There are several ways to edit a file. One of most common text editors for this is `Vi` or `Vim`. More rarely, there is the `Nano` editor. But these are only the default text editors build into every Linux distributions. You can always install `gedit` or `sublimetext` for a more easy experience.

**Vim**
Vim is an open source editors for all kinds of ASCII text, just like Nano. It is an improved clone of the previous Vi. It is an extremely powerful editor. For tasks that go beyond that, Vim provides an interface to external programs, such as `grep`, `awk`, `sed`. 

- `Normal` All inputs are considered as editor commands. 
- `Inser` All entered characters are inserted into the buffer.
- `Visual` The visual mode is used to mark a contiguous part of the text, which will be visually highlighted. 
- `Command` It allows us to enter single-line commands at the bottom of the editor. Usually helps with replacing text section, deleting, and sorting.
- `Replace` The newly entered will overwrite existing characters unless there are no more old characters at the current cursor position
- `Ex` Emulates the behavior of the text editors Ex (super import)

Can always use the `vimtutor` to help understand and learn how the vim text editor works.
